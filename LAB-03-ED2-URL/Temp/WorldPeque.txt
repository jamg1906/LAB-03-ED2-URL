:Puerto Rico Economy

Overview:
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
    Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
    activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
    Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
    petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
    production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
    agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of
    income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the
    disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism
    infrastructure has been especially hard hit.

:Reunion Economy

Overview:
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
    85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
    well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France.

:Romania Economy

Overview:
    Industry, which accounts for about one-third of the labor force and
    generates over half the GDP, suffers from an aging capital plant and
    persistent shortages of energy. The year 1991 witnessed about a 17% drop in
    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
    unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
    flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the
    dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of fuel and equipment in 1991
    contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and
    a poor distribution system. The new government is loosening the tight
    central controls of CEAUSESCU'S command economy. It has instituted moderate
    land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and
    it has liberalized private agricultural output. Also, the new regime is
    permitting the establishment of private enterprises, largely in services,
    handicrafts, and small-scale industry. A law providing for the privatization
    of large state firms has been passed. Most of the large state firms have
    been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares and
    assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has halted
    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
    export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. Furthermore, real
    wages in Romania fell about 20% in 1991, contributing to the unrest which
    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September. The new government continues
    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items.

:Russia Economy

Overview:
    Russia, one of the world's largest economies, possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the now-dismantled USSR, it
    had produced 60% of total output, with 55% of the total labor force and 60%
    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its world-class deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings. Self-sufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russia's
    machine-building sector - 60% of the old USSR's - lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial
    sectors - chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food
    processing - also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the
    transition to a more market-oriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets; substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
    Russia inherited 70% of the former USSR's defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production. Russia produces almost half of the old USSR's
    farm products, but most warm-climate crops must be imported. Under the old
    USSR, production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply, and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging. Rank-and-file Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles
    before it will lead to sustained economic growth.

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
    80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.

:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts and/or tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.

:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.

:Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview:
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
    output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
    roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
    Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders.

:Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview:
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other
    former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and
    manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence, as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations.

    in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the
    government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting
    the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.

:Sierra Leone Economy

Overview:
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
    employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
    accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
    March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms.

    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5% in 1991,
    down from 8.3% in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and
    lower growth in the financial and business services sector.

:Slovenia Economy

Overview:
    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with
    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not far
    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
    fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
    years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has
    led to severe short-term dislocations in production, employment, and trade
    ties. For example, overall industrial production fell 10% in 1991;
    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel, machine-building, chemical,
    and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics
    leading to further destruction of long-established trade channels and to an
    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rank-and-file people in the transition to a more market-oriented system. The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's
    comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.

:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 1991-92 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.

:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5% to 6% level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.

:Spain Economy

Overview:
    Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. In accordance with its
    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4%
    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
    fight inflation - around 7% in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to
    2.5% in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation - still
    hovering at 6%. Government officials also are worried about 16%
    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
    underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
    due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
    more displaced workers.

:Sudan Economy

Overview:
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
    weather, high inflation, and counterproductive economic policies. The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70%
    of new investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating
    1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work
    force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high
    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the
    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan
    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. Despite
    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
    World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the
    incentive to take economic risks.

:Suriname Economy

Overview:
    The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for about
    70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The economy has been in
    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
    bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform. High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
    activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.

:Svalbard Economy

Overview:
    Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9
    February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to
    exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,
    Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies
    still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are
    essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs
    nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
    services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
    trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

:Swaziland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies most of the
    labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which includes
    a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.
    Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore
    deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for
    asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
    hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
    Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it
    receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.

:Sweden Economy

Overview:
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
    World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
    mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has
    essentially full employment, a modern distribution system, excellent
    internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
    hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
    about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for
    50% of output and exports. In the last few years, however, this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation, growing
    absenteeism, and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets.
    The new center-right government, facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until 1993, is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Sweden's recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in 1995. The free-market-oriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth, maintain price stability, lower unemployment, create a more
    efficient welfare state, and further adapt to EC standards. The measures
    include: cutting taxes, particularly the value-added tax (VAT) and levies on
    new and small business; privatization; liberalizing foreign ownership
    restrictions; and opening the welfare system to competition and private
    alternatives, which the government will still finance. Growth is expected to
    remain flat in 1992, but increase slightly in 1993, while inflation should
    remain around 3% for the next few years. On the down side, unemployment may
    climb to slightly over 4% in 1993, and the budget deficit will reach nearly
    $9 billion in 1992.

    purchasing power equivalent - $147.6 billion, per capita $17,200; real
    growth rate -1.1% (1991)

:Switzerland Economy

Overview:
    Switzerland's economic success is matched in few other nations. Per capita
    output, general living standards, education and science, health care, and
    diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Economic stability helps promote the
    important banking and tourist sectors. Since World War II, Switzerland's
    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the 1990s,
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects.
    After 8 years of growth, the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991
    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy. In the second half of 1992, however, Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth, despite inflation and unemployment problems.
    GDP growth for 1992 may be just under 1%, inflation should drop from 5.9% to
    3.5%, and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
    15% to $5 billion, due to increased exports to Germany. Unemployment,
    however, is forecast to rise to 1.6% in 1992, up from 1.3% in 1991 and 0.5%
    in 1990.

:Syria Economy

Overview:
    Syria's state-dominated Ba`thist economy has benefited from the Gulf war,
    increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation. Economic
    growth averaged nearly 12% annually in 1990-91, buoyed by increased oil
    production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991
    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab,
    European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's
    war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,
    restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian
    purchases. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large

:Taiwan Economy

Overview:
    Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
    guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership of
    some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged about
    9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster
    and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes
    about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13
    among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
    steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
    industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
    Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The tightening of labor markets
    has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.

:Tajikistan Economy

Overview:
    Tajikistan has had the lowest standard of living and now faces the bleakest
    economic prospects of the 15 former Soviet republics. Agriculture is the
    main economic sector, normally accounting for 38% of employment and
    featuring cotton and fruits. Industry is sparse, bright spots including
    electric power and aluminum production based on the country's sizable
    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
    metal-cutting machine tools. In 1991 and early 1992, disruptions in food
    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and
    political instability have meant that the republic's leadership could make
    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.

:Tanzania Economy

Overview:
    Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47% of GDP,
    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
    accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
    rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991
    was featured by a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase
    in output of minerals led by gold.

:Thailand Economy

Overview:
    Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
    year of 8% growth in 1991, although down from an annual average of 11%
    growth between 1987 and 1990. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
    sector benefited from export-oriented investment. The manufacturing and
    service sectors have accounted for the lion's share of economic growth.
    Thailand's traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to
    increase in 1991, to $11 billion; earnings from tourism and remittances grew
    marginally as a result of the Gulf War; and Thailand's import bill grew,
    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly
    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
    fast-moving economy; Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects - especially for
    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities - needed to refurbish the
    country's overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the military's
    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused
    international businessmen to question Thailand's political stability.
    Thailand's general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the
    continuation of the government's progrowth measures.

:Togo Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
    for about 35% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the labor force.
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
    account for about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
    exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
    serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
    past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
    of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
    investment and attempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
    Political unrest throughout 1991, however, has jeopardized the reform
    program and has disrupted vital economic activity.

:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
    Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through most of the
    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts
    for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The government, in
    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed
    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
    Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces about 3%
    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base.

    exchange rate conversion - $4.9 billion, per capita $3,600; real growth rate

:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
    of light manufactures. Following two years of drought-induced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMF-supported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.

:Turkey Economy

Overview:
    The impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
    launched in 1980 have begun to peter out. Although real growth in per capita
    GDP averaged 5% annually between 1983 and 1988, recent economic performance
    has fallen substantially. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain
    high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
    to a free market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
    employing about half of the work force, accounting for 18% of GDP, and
    contributing 19% to exports. The government has launched a
    multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which
    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned
    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish
    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1991 in stronger shape than
    Ankara had expected. Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the
    coalition allies of more than $4 billion have helped offset the burden.

:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
    Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
    government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
    monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas
    and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.

:Tuvalu Economy

Overview:
    Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil.
    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
    remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
    trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
    supported also by Japan and South Korea.

:Uganda Economy

Overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
    does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum
    prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and
    boosting production and export earnings. During the period 1990-91, the
    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
    exports, and gradually improving domestic security.

:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
    Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
    resources, the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
    military, and economic power of the USSR. After Russia, the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
    well-developed and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR. In
    early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a near-term recovery of output.

:United Arab Emirates Economy

Overview:
    The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes per
    capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based on oil and gas, and

    Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE has undergone a profound
    transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to
    a modern state with a high standard of living. At present levels of
    production, crude oil reserves should last for over 100 years.

:United Kingdom Economy

Overview:
    The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers, and
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
    programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
    basic thrust of THATCHER's efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
    Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
    standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor
    force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
    about 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an
    energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary
    energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
    industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into recession after eight
    years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one
    quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1991. Between
    1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11% to about 6%, but crept back up to
    8% in 1991 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the
    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings
    in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.

:United States Economy

Overview:
    The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced economy
    in the world, with a per capita GDP of $22,470, the largest among major
    industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the
    longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of
    the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a
    combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,
    Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output failed
    to recover, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.
    Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade
    deficits.

:Uruguay Economy

Overview:
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early 1980s.
    In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by 1.5%. The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone
    contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
    particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In 1991,
    domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990, but various government factors,
    including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong opposition.

:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
    produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton. Moscow's push for ever-increasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),
    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.

:Vietnam Economy

Overview:
    This is a formerly centrally planned, developing economy with extensive
    government ownership and control of productive facilities. The economy is
    primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 70% of the labor force and
    accounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop; substantial amounts of
    maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are also grown. The government
    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral
    resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important
    export item. Oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with
    production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase
    in the years ahead. Following the end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed
    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
    north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
    assistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Communist
    countries. Inflation, although down from recent triple-digit levels, is
    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again.
    Per capita output is among the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the
    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
    economic activity over to the private sector.

    subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import
    taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and

:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.
